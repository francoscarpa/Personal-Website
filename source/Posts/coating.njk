<p class="underMetadata">My early-2015 MacBook Pro has started experiencing some Apple computers' well-known issue about the anti-reflective coating quite some time ago. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/20/macbook-pro-anti-reflective-repair-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple itself has confirmed the problem</a> and decided to let its users enjoy an appropriate treatment. However, my laptop is considered too old, so I had to take him to an Apple repair center and pay a lot of money to fix it. Surfing the Net, I found some users had tried home-made (and risky) solutions, using the most disparate chemical agents we all have in our homes. Since the issue caused an awful experience when using the MacBook with a low level of screen brightness, I decided to try one of these methods. In particular, I used baking soda and water, as suggested in <a href="https://homeexplained.com/how-to-remove-anti-reflective-coating-from-macbook-pro-the-best-and-easiest-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a>, and it worked.</p>

<p>These are photos of the screen before the treatment:</p>

<p>If you experience the same problem with your Apple computer and take responsibility for your actions, you could try it. In my case, it was a success.</p>
