<p>My name is Franco; I’m a C# (since January, 2020 at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nebula-cloud/">Nebula</a>) and Web developer. I’m Italian, but I write in English, so mistakes occur. This choice was a matter of compromise: Italian would make the audience much smaller than using a universal language such as English. What matters are the content and the message I convey. Nevertheless, if you find errors, please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>. The views expressed here are my personal views. I’m interested about:</p>
