description: The most important thing on a web page is the content. It comes first. Showing the user the information they are looking for should be the first goal when creating a website.

<p class="underMetadata">I have always believed the web was a nice place where everyone could roam freely, with any browser available, from every corner of the planet. A place that we all have found ourselves to attend, someone to look for the recipe of the grandmother's cake, someone to consult some university courses or to play an online video game. Loving the web I thought I would have loved the web's languages, that is HTML, CSS and JavaScript (I'm speaking about the front-end side, which is what I love). And I did. But during the process of deepening my knowledge in the web field I'm increasingly bumping into articles and interviews of people that support, in certain specific areas, it's not all peaches and cream. A first example is given by the work of <a href="https://www.crockford.com/2005-10-24.html">Douglas Crockford</a>, a character well known by the JavaScript community especially for his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> and <a href="https://howjavascriptworks.com/">How JavaScript Works</a>, in which he says the language is “sprinkled” here and there with defects. Thinking that this language was going to become my favorite one (not because I particularly loved its syntax which, in fact, sometimes create headaches, but as a simple consequence of a fact: I loved the web and JavaScript has always been its lingua franca) almost embarrassed me. So I came up with an idea: my love for this language was completely random, nothing more. If the web was “written” in C, then C would have become my favorite language.</p>

<p>JavaScript is the programming language that interests me the most, because with it I can develop for the web.</p>

<p>A very similar discussion regards the subject of privacy. It never interested me and I have only recently questioned my beliefs, previously built around the general thought “I do not care because I have nothing to hide”. In a short time it has been completely overturned: now I care about my data and not by chance I started using tools (browsers, plugins and so on) that work to ensure greater protection while surfing the net.</p>

<p>Why did I made this introduction? Because, illuminated by <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>'s <a href="http://www.deathtobullshit.com/">Death to Bullshit</a>, I'm now aware that the web is largely composed of sites that drown in a sea of ​​crap:</p>
<ul>
  <li>invasive pop-ups;</li>
  <li>advertisements;</li>
  <li>windows that suggest to sign up for newsletters, making some registration or inviting you to follow a Facebook page;</li>
</ul>
<p>and much, much more junk.</p>

<p>In this sea of ​​excesses it's unfortunately easy to get lost and lose the point where the information you need is. Is all that advertising to make some money really necessary? Are all those invasive windows so damn essential? The answer in many cases is no! Why should a simple site like a personal blog be stuffed with so many superfluous and hateful elements (because yes, they just annoy the user)? Sites seem to scream at us when we visit them, while we would like instead a quiet navigation through their contents, without feeling oppressed by the suggestions of continuous pop-ups and advertisements. The web is a means of communication, a site is a collection of information. When creating a site, we must think first to the content, its real protagonist. A site serves precisely to communicate, and the recipient of this communication is the user who reaches us. Our task is to allow him to find what he needs in the simplest and most peaceful way possible.</p>
